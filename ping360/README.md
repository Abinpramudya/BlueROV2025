# Ping360 Package Collection

This directory contains a set of ROS 2 packages for working with the **Ping360 imaging sonar**. This project has been the main focus of my internship, where I explored how to operate and integrate this sensor in real-world scenarios.

### Sensor Information

* **Device**: [Blue Robotics Ping360 Sonar](https://bluerobotics.com/store/sonars/imaging-sonars/ping360-sonar-r1-rp/)
* **Documentation**: [Official Product Page](https://bluerobotics.com/store/sonars/imaging-sonars/ping360-sonar-r1-rp/)

### Acknowledgements

Based on the work by [Centrale Nantes Robotics](https://github.com/CentraleNantesRobotics/ping360_sonar/), which provided the core codebase for the sonar interface.

### Included Packages

* `ping360_sonar`: Main ROS 2 node for Ping360
* `ping360_sonar_msgs`: Custom message definitions used by the node
* `ping_sonar_ros-master`: Prerequisite utility package from the MIR program

### Project Overview

These packages are tested with a **BlueROV2 Heavy Configuration**, particularly in a controlled water tank environment. The goal is to evaluate how the Ping360 performs under different conditions and explore various configuration strategies.

### Recommended Tools

* `rqt`: For easy GUI-based ROS visualization
* `Foxglove Studio`: For a cleaner and more modern view of sonar data

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup

Place all the listed packages into your ROS 2 workspace (`src` folder), then build and source:

```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. First-Time Run

Before running the node, check that the sensor is properly connected:

1. Open your BlueROV‚Äôs web interface: `http://192.168.2.2/` (or your specific IP)
2. Go to the **Ping360** tab and ensure the sensor is detected and responsive

if everything is in order, you can ran the code with following command, make sure everything has been built and sourced properly.


You can run the code with the following code
```bash
ros2 run ping360_sonar ping360.py
```

### ROS 2 Topics

Once the node is running, you‚Äôll see the following topics:

1. **`/scan`** ‚Äì Can be ignored; publishes empty or unused data
   ‚Ä¢ Message type: `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan`

2. **`/scan_echo`** ‚Äì Main data stream containing raw sonar echo information
   ‚Ä¢ Message type: `ping360_sonar_msgs/msg/SonarEcho`

3. **`/scan_image`** ‚Äì Visualization of the sonar scan as an image
   ‚Ä¢ Message type: `sensor_msgs/msg/Image`

> You can use tools like `rqt`, `ros2 topic echo`, or **Foxglove Studio** to visualize these topics in real-time.


You can add that section like this, using a placeholder for the image path so it‚Äôs easy to update later:

### Visual Output in Foxglove

Once everything is running, you can visualize the sonar data in **Foxglove Studio**. This provides a clean, real-time interface for inspecting the Ping360 output.

Here‚Äôs an example of what the sonar data looks like:

# A Deeper Dive
You can use the **RQT user interface** to modify various parameters of the Ping360 sonar during runtime. However, if you want to set **default parameters**, you‚Äôll need to modify the source code directly.

Open the file `ping360.py` located inside the `ping360_sonar` package under the `src` folder. Focus on the section where the default parameters are defined:

```python
parameters = {
    'gain': [0, 0, 2],
    'frequency': 740,
    'angle_sector': [360, 60, 360],
    'scan_threshold': [200, 0, 255],
    'angle_step': [1, 1, 20],
    'image_size': [200, 200, 1000],
    'image_rate': [50, 50, 2000],
    'speed_of_sound': [1500, 1000, 2000],
    'range_max': [6, 1, 50],
    'publish_image': True,
    'publish_scan': True,
    'publish_echo': True,
    'image_min_threshold': [10, 0, 255],
}
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameter Descriptions

### 1. `gain`

* Controls the **intensity (sensitivity)** of the sonar.
* A higher value makes the sonar more sensitive but may also increase noise.

### 2. `frequency`

* The **base frequency** of the sonar in kHz.
* Usually left at the default value unless fine-tuning for a specific environment.

### 3. `angle_sector`

* Defines the **scanning angle range**.
* The sonar rotates using a stepper motor, so you can limit the scan to a forward-facing arc (e.g., 60¬∞ to 360¬∞).

### 4. `scan_threshold`

* Sets the minimum signal strength (echo intensity) required for a point to be considered valid.
* Possibly sets a threshold for valid return signals; needs confirmation.

### 5. `angle_step`

* Defines the **angular resolution** of the scan.
* Smaller steps ‚Üí higher resolution but slower scan.
* Larger steps ‚Üí faster scan but lower detail.

### 6. `image_size`

* defines the pixel resolution or dimensions of the sonar image.

### 7. `image_rate`

* controls how frequently images are generated or updated.
* Higher rate ‚Üí more frequent updates, but increased CPU/network usage

### 8. `speed_of_sound`

* Critical for accurate range measurements.
* Refer to environmental documentation: **salinity, temperature, and pressure** significantly affect this value.

### 9. `range_max`

* Sets the **maximum detection range** of the sonar in meters.
* Adjust based on your operational needs (e.g., `6`, `10`, or `20` meters).

### 10. `publish_*` flags (`image`, `scan`, `echo`)

* Enable or disable publishing of sonar data on ROS topics.
* Useful for reducing network load or debugging specific outputs.

### 11. `image_min_threshold`

* A custom filtering parameter to **remove low-intensity noise** from images.
* Values below this threshold are blacked out, helping to visually isolate relevant objects.

## üìå Notes

* Values can be adjusted through **RQT** during runtime.
* If you're unsure about a parameter (e.g., `scan_threshold`, `image_size`, `image_rate`), it's best to consult the **Ping360 BlueRobotics Documentation** or experiment incrementally.
* Visualization samples and performance comparisons (e.g., angle step effects) can be added below.

Sure! Here's the content rewritten as a polished `README.md` section for including the rosbag replay instructions:

# üéûÔ∏è Offline Data Replay with ROS Bag

If you want to **replay the sonar data locally** without connecting to the actual robot, you can use the pre-recorded **ROS bag** file provided below.

You can download the bag file from this Google Drive folder:
