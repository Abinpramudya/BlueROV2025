# BlueROV2025

Welcome to **BlueROV2025** — a repository for all BlueROV experiments conducted during my **Summer Internship 2025**.

This project is currently a work in progress and will be updated as development continues. It contains a collection of ROS 2 Humble packages designed to work with the **BlueROV Heavy configuration**.

> ⚠️ A full and proper README is coming soon... *assuming I don’t get too lazy!*
